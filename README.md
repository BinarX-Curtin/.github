# BinarX GiHub

Welcome to the BinarX GitHub organisation. These repositories contain resources, hardware and software developed by the Space Science and Technology Centre for the BinarX STEM outreach program to support WA school students to design, build and fly their own spacecraft payloads, that will go to space on future CubeSats developed by the Binar Space Program.

You can find out more about the BinarX program and how to get involved here: https://www.binarspace.com/binarx/, and more about the Space Science and Technology Centre here: https://sstc.curtin.edu.au/.
